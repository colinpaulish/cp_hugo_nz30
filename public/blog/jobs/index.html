<h2 id="opening">Opening</h2>
<p>It’s hard to fault policymakers and local leaders in fossil-fuel heavy regions for their pushback towards green legislation and general progress. Shifts in status quo are scary, particularly when the writing on the wall is in sharpie - renewable jobs are coming, and they will negatively impact fossil fuel employment. Industrial shifts can and have brought huge pain to governments, local economies, families, and people. From 1950 to 2000, the “Rust Belt’s” share of US manufacturing employment fell from one-half to one-third with similar magnitude drops when taking a step back calculating aggregate-level employment (source). If certain regions are upended with widespread turmoil during this shift to renewable energy, then we have failed. Instead of fighting policy change, policy leader conversations should shift to productive discussions that focus on the symbiotic potential of green jobs to the area. Two things can be true – we can see huge losses in fossil fuel jobs AND see those same areas thrive.</p>
<p>In this post, my goal is to start the conversation and hopefully inspire more questions than what I answer. I open with a review of several academic studies that have forecasted employment change using different data analysis techniques. I will then shift to “real-life” data providing county-level analysis using data provided by XX. Here I  observe the distribution of fossil fuel and renewable energy jobs today and how that has changed over the last five years. I comment at the end what this all means and begin thoughts of how we can not just mitigate the negative potential in certain areas but set them up to thrive.</p>
<h2 id="energy-transition---what-we-know-today">Energy Transition - what we &ldquo;know&rdquo; today</h2>
<p>My goal in this section is NOT to provide a comprehensive literature review of academic papers covering the potential impact of the labor economy during the shift. Rather, I hope to set up a structure of how we may want to to think of it by breaking the question into three core questions with other factors of consideration.</p>
<p>The first, and debatably most obvious and critical question is – will this shift lead to more or fewer jobs? Two recent papers paint an optimistic picture. Each uses employment factors which aim to estimate jobs based on investment and/or production of a commodity. In this analysis studying 28 EU countries + Norway, the authors fit an autoregressive regression time series model to estimate employment and concluded the transition will have a small but positive impact. This paper produced a more nuanced set of results but had similar findings. In their “aggressive” emission cutting scenario, jobs increased initially, peaking in 2025 with a net increase of close to one million jobs before seeing a decrease of ~2 million jobs as efficiency gains cut labor employment. This may seem like a suboptimal outcome, but it is important to note this study only looks at direct energy jobs and does not include labor related to transmission, battery storage, decentralized PV, eating, hydrogen and energy efficiency all of which are huge components of the renewable transition.</p>
<p>With greater confidence that the green transition will not lead to the destruction of energy jobs, we now move to a more nuanced question of how this job effect will be distributed spatially. Two pieces are needed to think through this – both the potential loss of fossil fuel jobs and the gain of green jobs. This paper provides useful views to understand employment in the fossil fuel industry with clear concentrations in the middle part of the country. This points to these communities having a larger-than-average impact of the transition. Conversely, green jobs have been concentrated in those same  [add in what we see from data analysis]. Anything from the USEER report?</p>
<p>So now we suspect, energy jobs are here to stay and there is at least some relationship between loss and gain of green jobs with policy levers that can be deployed to even those delta. The final key question is how the mix of jobs may change. Returning again to this study, jobs by tech are more obvious. Coal, gas, and oil see huge decreases while green tech, primarily wind and solar, continue to see massive gains in employment. More interestingly, the mix of jobs shifts greatly. Jobs shift from fuel supply and production to operation &amp; maintenance type jobs. Gains are also seen in manufacturing and construction &amp; installation. This passes the logic test as energy systems are completely disrupted shifting from massive regional energy suppliers to tens, hundreds of thousands of distributed energy systems (e.g., rooftop solar).</p>
<p>A sample of some other considerations include wages, skills, labor mobility, and tech (productivity) advancements.</p>
