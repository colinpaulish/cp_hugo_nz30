      <description>The [WIP] Loss and Damage Tool Check out what I built to add some data to this conceptually fascinating topic: source
Overview General consensus coming out of COP27 was disappointment. Commitments once again exceeded action and many climate enthusiasts left with more questions than answers. An exciting development that did come out of COP27 was the agreement of a ‘Loss and Damage’ fund.

      <description>Opening It’s hard to fault policymakers and local leaders in fossil-fuel heavy regions for their pushback towards green legislation. Shifts in status quo are scary, particularly when the writing on the wall is in sharpie - renewable jobs are coming, and they will negatively impact fossil fuel employment. Industrial shifts can and have brought huge pain to governments, local economies, families, and people.
