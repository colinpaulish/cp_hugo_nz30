I'm **Colin Paulish**, a Data Analyst + Problem Solver.

I love to combine **critical thinking** with **data science** to build powerful solutions. I focus on the problem and stakeholders, value the complexity, and design analyses/tools/stories that connect in a logical and impactful way.

I am particularly interested in the most critical and complex problem modern society has faced - **climate change**. I hope to be a small (and positive) force of change in this arena to curb emissions while improving the quality of life for all. We can do this.

Check out my (growing) list of blogs where I utilize data science to explore an integral climate topic.

Please reach out if you want to chat, collaborate, or anything else!
