I'm **Colin Paulish**, a Data Analyst + Problem Solver.

I love to combine critical thinking with data science to build creative solutions.

I am particularly interested in how the growing climate adaptation and mitigation sector can utilize data to better inform decision-making and spread its reach.

Check out my (growing) list of blogs where I discuss a climate + data related topic.

Please reach out if you want to chat, collaborate, or anything else!
